  Title: Calm after and before the storm
  Message: We have been stranded on this island for several days now. Most of the
    fleet got destroyed. We got out safe, but there might still be people out there.
    We need to use our last ship to scavenge for resources, building up a stable economy
    in case more refugees arrive.
